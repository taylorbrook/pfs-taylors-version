# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 1 - Planning Complete

Planning complete. Complexity score calculated (5.0 - Very Complex). Phased implementation strategy defined with 4 DSP phases and 2 GUI phases.

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type defined: MIDI-triggered Sampler
- Professional examples researched: Music Thing Modular Radio Music (Eurorack)
- DSP feasibility verified via Context7 JUCE documentation
- Parameter ranges researched from industry standards
- Design sync verified: UI mockup aligns with creative brief

**Stage 1:** ✓ Complete
- Complexity score: 5.0 (Very Complex - maximum)
- Implementation strategy: Phased (4 DSP phases, 2 GUI phases)
- Total estimated duration: ~2.5 hours
- Files: plan.md created

## Next Steps

1. Continue to Stage 2 (Foundation - stub in Phase 3)
2. Review plan details
3. Adjust complexity assessment
4. Review contracts (parameter-spec, architecture)
5. Pause here

## Context to Preserve

**Plugin Type:** MIDI-triggered Sampler
**Processing:** Time-domain sample playback with variable speed resampling

**JUCE Modules Identified** (Context7: `/juce-framework/juce`):
- AudioFormatManager + AudioFormatReader (file loading)
- AudioFormatReaderSource (streaming playback)
- MultiChannelResampler (variable speed/pitch)
- MidiBuffer (MIDI triggering)
- File (folder scanning)

**Custom DSP Required:**
- File queueing system (Station changes)
- Start position handling
- Seamless looping
- Speed-based resampling (pow(2, param))
- Waveform downsampling for UI
- MIDI re-trigger logic

**Complexity Estimate:** Medium-High
- 4 parameters (simple)
- File I/O + folder management (moderate)
- MIDI triggering + variable speed (moderate)
- Continuous playback state machine (complex)
- WebView UI with waveform (moderate)
