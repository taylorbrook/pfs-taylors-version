# Resume Point

## Current State: UI Mockup v1 Created

UI mockup v1 has been generated and is ready for review in your browser.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Generative lush pad with nested random modulation
- Parameters specified: 3 knobs (Timbre, Filter Cutoff, Reverb Amount)
- UI vision captured: Minimal 3-knob interface with subtle modulation visualization
- Use cases identified: Background atmospheres, evolving textures, harmonic beds

**UI Mockup v1:** ✓ Generated (awaiting review)
- Layout: 3 large knobs (100px diameter) in horizontal row
- Window size: 600×300px (fixed size)
- Visual style: Soft neomorphic design with warm cream gradients
- Special features: Subtle pulsing glow behind knobs (modulation visualization)
- Files created: v1-ui.yaml, v1-ui-test.html
- Validation: Layout bounds ✓, WebView constraints ✓

## Next Steps

1. Review mockup in browser (now open) and iterate if needed
2. Finalize mockup and proceed to implementation
3. Save mockup as aesthetic template
4. Other

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Synth (Instrument)
- Core concept: 8-voice polyphonic pad with 3 detuned sine oscillators per voice, FM feedback, harmonic saturation, nested random LFO modulation creating generative evolving texture
- DSP: Slow attack/long release envelope, low-pass filter with fixed resonance, large hall reverb, velocity affects volume + filter brightness
- Modulation system: Random LFOs modulating panning/feedback/saturation, with LFO speed and depth themselves modulated by other random LFOs (generative, never-repeating evolution)
