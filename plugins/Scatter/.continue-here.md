# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 3 Phase 3.2 - Pitch Shifting + Scale Quantization Complete

Pitch-shifted grains with scale quantization (5 scales), root note transposition, and playback rate modulation implemented. Ready for Phase 3.3 (Spatial + Reverse + Feedback).

## Completed So Far

**Stage 0:** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type: Effect (Granular Reversed Delay)
- Complexity tier: 5-6 (DEEP research - 30 minutes)
- Professional examples researched: Output Portal, Red Panda Particle, GrainScanner, Audio Damage Quanta 2
- JUCE modules identified: juce_dsp (DelayLine, WindowingFunction, DryWetMixer), juce_core (Random)
- DSP feasibility verified: All primitives map to JUCE classes or simple custom code
- Parameter ranges researched
- Complexity score: 5.0
- Strategy: Phase-based implementation
- Plan documented with 5 phases (3 DSP phases, 2 GUI phases)
- Estimated duration: 20-25 hours total

**Stage 2:** ✓ Complete
- Foundation + Shell complete
- Build system operational (CMakeLists.txt with JUCE 8 patterns)
- 9 parameters implemented via APVTS
- State management implemented
- Placeholder UI

**Stage 3 Phase 3.1:** ✓ Complete
- Granular delay buffer (juce::dsp::DelayLine with Lagrange3rd interpolation)
- 64 polyphonic grain voices (pre-allocated array)
- Grain scheduler (density-based spawning with overlap control)
- Hann window generator (pre-calculated lookup tables)
- Voice allocation logic (linear search with simple stealing)
- Grain playback loop (read, window, sum active grains)
- Real-time safe: No allocations in processBlock()
- Mono output for testing (stereo in Phase 3.3)

**Stage 3 Phase 3.2:** ✓ Complete
- Scale lookup tables (Chromatic, Major, Minor, Pentatonic, Blues)
- Quantization algorithm (nearest-note mapping to scale)
- Playback rate calculation (2^(semitones/12))
- Random pitch generation (±7 semitones, scaled by pitch_random parameter)
- Root note transposition (0-11 semitones)
- Integrated pitch-shifted playback (Lagrange3rd interpolation)

## Next Steps

1. Stage 3 Phase 3.3: Spatial + Reverse + Feedback (3-4 hours)
   - Random pan positioning per grain
   - Reverse playback direction (50/50 probability)
   - Feedback loop (grain output → delay buffer input)
   - Dry/wet mixer (juce::dsp::DryWetMixer)
   - Stereo processing (L/R channels independent)
2. After Phase 3.3 complete, proceed to Stage 4 Phase 4.1 (GUI Layout + Controls)
3. Build and test Phase 3.2 implementation

## Files Created

**Stage 0:**
- plugins/Scatter/.ideas/architecture.md (Complete DSP specification with 10 core components)
- plugins/Scatter/.ideas/plan.md (Phase breakdown: 3 DSP phases, 2 GUI phases)

**Stage 2:**
- plugins/Scatter/CMakeLists.txt (JUCE 8 build configuration)
- plugins/Scatter/Source/PluginProcessor.h
- plugins/Scatter/Source/PluginProcessor.cpp (APVTS with 9 parameters)
- plugins/Scatter/Source/PluginEditor.h
- plugins/Scatter/Source/PluginEditor.cpp (Placeholder UI)

**Stage 3 Phase 3.1:**
- plugins/Scatter/Source/PluginProcessor.h (grain voice structure, DSP members)
- plugins/Scatter/Source/PluginProcessor.cpp (granular engine implementation)

**Stage 3 Phase 3.2:**
- plugins/Scatter/Source/PluginProcessor.h (scale tables, playback rate in GrainVoice)
- plugins/Scatter/Source/PluginProcessor.cpp (pitch shifting, scale quantization)

## Build Artifacts

(Build will be executed by plugin-workflow after this agent completes)

## Context to Preserve

**Architecture highlights:**
- Granular synthesis engine: 64 polyphonic grain voices with Hann windowing
- Pitch shifting: Playback rate adjustment (time-domain, not phase vocoder)
- Scale quantization: 5 scale types (Chromatic, Major, Minor, Pentatonic, Blues)
- Real-time visualization: Particle field showing grain positions (200×200px)
- Feedback loop: Grain output → delay buffer input for evolving textures

**Implementation strategy:**
- Phase 3.1 (6-8h): Core granular engine
- Phase 3.2 (3-4h): Pitch shifting + scale quantization
- Phase 3.3 (3-4h): Spatial, reverse playback, feedback
- Phase 4.1 (3h): Layout + basic controls
- Phase 4.2 (4-5h): Particle field visualization

**Key risks:**
- CPU usage with 64 voices (~50-65% estimated)
- Visualization performance overhead
- Buffer boundary handling for reverse playback
- Fallback: Reduce to 32 or 16 voices if CPU exceeds targets

**JUCE 8 patterns applied:**
- Pattern #1: juce_generate_juce_header() after target_link_libraries()
- Pattern #4: Effect bus configuration (input + output)
- Pattern #7: ParameterID { "id", 1 } format (JUCE 8 requirement)
- Real-time safe parameter access via getRawParameterValue()->load()
