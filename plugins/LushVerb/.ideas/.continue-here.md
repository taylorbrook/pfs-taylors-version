# Resume Point

## Current State: UI Mockup Complete & Contracts Locked

UI mockup v3 finalized and all implementation files generated. Creative brief updated with design evolution. Parameter specification locked. Ready to proceed to implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Stunning lush reverb inspired by BigSky
- Parameters specified: SIZE, DAMPING, SHIMMER, MIX (4 total)

**UI Design:** ✓ Complete (v3)
- Industrial 19" rack unit aesthetic with gold accents
- Four evenly-spaced machined knobs (70px diameter)
- LED output meter with traffic light thresholds
- Compact 500×300px form factor
- Design evolution documented in creative brief

**Design Validation:** ✓ Complete
- design-sync validation run
- Drift detected and resolved (shimmer parameter, visual aesthetic)
- Creative brief updated to reflect finalized design

**Contracts Generated:** ✓ Complete
- parameter-spec.md (locked specification for 4 parameters)
- v3-ui.yaml (design specification)
- v3-ui.html (production HTML)
- v3-PluginEditor.h/cpp (C++ boilerplate)
- v3-CMakeLists.txt (WebView build config)
- v3-integration-checklist.md (implementation guide)

## Next Steps

1. Start implementation (`/implement LushVerb`) - Begin Stage 0 (Research)
2. Save aesthetic template - Add industrial rack aesthetic to library
3. Review contracts - Verify all specifications before implementation

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Audio Effect (Reverb)
- Core concept: Lush, beautiful, stunning reverb with simple controls
- Character: Ambient/ethereal with smooth endless tails
- Parameters: 4 user-controllable (SIZE, DAMPING, SHIMMER, MIX)
- Modulation: Built-in subtle chorus (not user-controlled)
- Visual style: Industrial rack unit (evolved from original "clean, modern, inspiring")

**Design Evolution:**
- Shimmer: Changed from "always-on subtle" to user-controllable (0-100%, default 30%)
  - Rationale: Flexibility for traditional reverb or extreme textures
- Visual aesthetic: Changed from "clean, modern" to "industrial rack unit"
  - Rationale: Matches existing plugin style, communicates professional quality
- LED meter added for visual feedback
